#Title: File Content Viewer

Description: The File Content Viewer is a Flask web application that allows users to view the content of text files directly in their web browser. Users can select from a list of available text files and choose to view the entire content or specify start and end line numbers to display only a portion of the file. The application preserves any markup present in the text files, making it suitable for viewing formatted text such as HTML or Markdown. Additionally, the application gracefully handles errors and provides users with informative error messages in case of any issues.
